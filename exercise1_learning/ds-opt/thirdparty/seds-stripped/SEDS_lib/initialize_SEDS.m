function [Priors_0, Mu_0, Sigma_0] = initialize_SEDS(Data,K,varargin)
%
% This function finds a safe initial guess that will be used for SEDS
% optimization. The function can be called using:
%
%           [Priors_0, Mu_0, Sigma_0] = initialize_SEDS(Data,K)
%
% or
%       	[Priors_0, Mu_0, Sigma_0] = initialize_SEDS(Data,K,options)
%
% to also pass a structure of desired options.
%
% Inputs -----------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   o Data:    A 2d x N_Total matrix containing all demonstration data points.
%              Rows 1:d corresponds to trajectories and the rows d+1:2d
%              are their first time derivatives. Each column of Data stands
%              for a datapoint. All demonstrations are put next to each other 
%              along the second dimension. For example, if we have 3 demos
%              D1, D2, and D3, then the matrix Data is:
%                               Data = [[D1] [D2] [D3]]
%
%   o K:       1 x K array representing the prior probabilities of the K GMM 
%
%   o options: A structure to set the optional parameters of the solver.
%              Providing 'options' for initialization forces the function
%              to compute a nice initial guess for the main optimization.
%              It is highly recommended to call the function with this
%              variable. Please type
%
%                               doc SEDS_Solver
%
%              in MATLAB command window to get a list of available
%              parameters that can be passed to the solver via 'options'.
%
% Outputs ----------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   o Priors_0:  1 x K array representing the prior probabilities of the K GMM 
%                components.
%
%   o Mu_0:      2d x K array representing the centers of the K GMM components.
%
%   o Sigma_0:   2d x 2d x K array representing the covariance matrices of the 
%                K GMM components.
